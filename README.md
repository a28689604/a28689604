## 🧩 Open Source Contributions 
### React Hook Form (2M+ weekly downloads)

- **Performance:** Optimized `useFieldArray.replace` to be 300×–900× faster, eliminating full-form resolver re-execution and UI freezes ([#13140](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/13140))  
- **Correctness:** Fixed `isValid` not recomputing after async `reset()` value updates, resolving stale form state caused by internal mount flags ([#13126](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/13126))  
- **Type Safety:** Correctly handled branded primitive types in `DeepPartial`, preventing incorrect expansion into object structures ([#13222](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/13222))  
- **Validation:** Batched `isValidating` state updates with resolver results to avoid temporary inconsistent validation states ([#13181](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/13181))
- **Forms / Field Arrays:** Prevented ghost elements when using `useFieldArray` with `keepDirtyValues` during resets ([#13188](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/13188))

**Additional contributions:**  
Fixed edge cases involving keepIsValid, disabled field state, invalid date comparison, and improved Windows compatibility in tooling.
